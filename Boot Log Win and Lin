WINDOWS BOOT PROCESS

Mobaxterm – download it

tasklist /svc (shows services)

get-service (shoows running and stopped services)

The system is booting into safe mode. Identify Command used to diagnose boot issues.
BCDEDIT (looks at boot loader)

The system is booting into safe mode. Correct that, and reboot into the desktop.
BCDEDIT /deletevalue {default} safeboot
Shutdown /a
-------------------------or--------------------------
Windows + R
-------------------------or--------------------------
msconfig
boot
Click on Current
Turn safemode off
Shutdown /a
VM restart go into cmd run the shutdown /a

Prevent the system restart using the command line, and then identify persistence mechanisms that are
reverting the OS and boot loader configurations.
The flag is in the same folder as the persistence mechanism.
HINT: Copy the error message in its entirety to figure out what is happening to the system.
Run the following: start services.msc
Expand the name column and look for the suspicious service
Filter by description usually bad actors don’t put a description

Run PowerShell... if you can. Resolve PowerShell dependencies.
HINT: Search the entire file system for the PowerShell .dll and copy it back to where it needs to go. It is
hidden in China. The flag is a file in the directory with the .dll.
Back in safemood cmd run the command powershell. This will show the last known good location.
Cd into that path
Dir
Cd into the path
Tab to document with the hint
-------------------------or--------------------------
open cmd on desktop run shutdown /a
run powershell in cmd
follow the path to get the note
take the .dll and copy it into the path
Now run powershell in cmd
Once you fix and launch PowerShell, the console is changed to a custom layout. Figure out what file is
causing this, read the file, and inspect the file that it is referencing.
$PSHome
Test-path -path $Profile.allusersallhost (came back true so there is a profile)
$Profile.allusersallhost (to get directory)

get-content insert_path
Run function

LINUX BOOT PROCESS
lsblk (locate hard drive and partition)
cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg (look at grub configuration file)
ltrace -S cat /etc/passwd (showing system calls)
ltrace -S lsmod (modules)
init 6 (restart the box)
cat /etc/inittab (on SysV machine)
ls -l /etc/rc3.d/ (list contents of daemon directory)
Another name for background processes (or services) in Linux is a daemon
rc equivalent to run level rc1 – run level 1 rc3 – run level 3
ls -lisa /lib/systemd/system/default.target (showing default target unit)
/etc/profile – is under Linux Boot Process
How many wants dependencies does SystemD actually recognize for the default.target
HINT: Use the systemctl command with some arguments to make life easier. Flag format: #
systemctl show --property Wants default.target
The file /home/bombadil/mbroken is a copy of an MBR from another machine. Hash only the Bootstrap
section of the MBR using md5sum. The flag is the entire hash.
dd if=/home/bombadil/mbroken bs=446 count=1 status=none | md5sum
d59a68c7b6d62ecaa1376dfb73a3b7be
The file /home/bombadil/mbroken is a copy of an MBR from another machine. Hash the first partition of
the file using md5sum. The flag is the hash.
dd if=/home/bombadil/mbroken bs=1 skip=446 count=16 status=none | md5sum
2a5948fad4ec68170b23faaa2a16cef8
Locate the master boot record for one of the Linux machines and read it with xxd. What programming
language is the MBR written in? HINT: Look at the first three bytes
Assembly
The file /home/bombadil/mbroken is a copy of an MBR from another machine.
You will find the &quot;word&quot; GRUB in the output, hash using md5sum. The flag is the entire hash.
command to view MBR &quot;mbroken&quot;  
hd -n 512 mbroken
Once you get the output find the line with GRUB and use the hex to find md5sum
printf &quot;\x47\x52\x55\x42&quot; | md5sum
-printf is used instead of echo because printf more reliably allows for the output of binary data from hex codes. -
--The \xNN syntax is used to specify bytes in hexadecimal. So, \x47\x52\x55\x42 corresponds to the binary
representation of &quot;GRUB&quot;.
-The output of printf, which is the binary data for &quot;GRUB&quot;, is then piped into md5sum, which computes the
MD5 hash.

Identify the default run level on the SysV Init Linux machine.
2
What is the last script to run when the command init 6 is executed? Flag format: /absolute/path
NOTE: “Use the Minas_Tirith machine for this question.” (Sysv3)
/etc/init.d/reboot
https://os.cybbh.io/public/os/latest/007_linux_boot_process/linboot_fg.html#_6_1_2_run_levels
What run levels start the daemon that allows remote connections over port 22? Flag 2,3,4,5
NOTE: Use the Minas_Tirith machine for this question. (Sysv4)
Identify the file that init is symbolically-linked to, on the SystemD init machine.Flag format:
/absolute/path Reminder: Use your Terra machine for these SystemD challenges! (Systemd)
readlink -f $(which init)
Answer: /lib/systemd/systemd
What is the default target on the SystemD machine and where is it actually located? Flag format:
name.target,/absolute/path NOTE: Use the SystemD Machine for this question. (Systemd)
systemctl get-default
systemctl status $(systemctl get-default) | grep -i loaded
Answer: graphical.target,/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target
What unit does the graphical.target want to start, based solely on its configuration file? HINT: Targets
deal with which init system? Which machine should you be looking for this flag, on?
NOTE: Use the SystemD Machine for this question. (Systemd)
cat /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target
Answer: display-manager.service
What dependency to graphical.target will stop it from executing if it fails to start, based solely on its static
configuration file? NOTE: Use the SystemD Machine for this question. (Systemd)
cat /lib/systemd/system/default.target | tail -n 8
Answer: multi-user.target
How many wants dependencies does SystemD actually recognize for the default.target HINT: Use the
systemctl command with some arguments to make life easier. Flag format: #
NOTE: Use the SystemD Machine for this question.
systemctl show --property Wants default.target
What is the full path to the binary used for standard message logging? HINT: Standard message logging
is standardized across UNIX systems. NOTE: As the challenge name suggests, use the SystemD machine
for this question. Flag format: /absolute/path
They are looking for the rsyslog daemon, answer: /usr/sbin/rsyslogd
Identify the Linux Kernel being loaded by the Grub, by examining its configuration.
Enter the command used by the Grub, and the full path to the Kernel, as the flag.
Flag Format: command,kernel location HINT: Click me for help understanding Grub commands
Machine: Minas_Tirith
cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Detecting BIOS or UEFI on Windows

Q: How can I tell if my machine is running BIOS or UEFI?

findstr /C:"Detected boot environment" "C:\Windows\Panther\Setupact.log"
Get-Content C:\Windows\Panther\Setupact.log | Select-String "Detected boot environment"


    A2: Use the bcedit command

bcdedit | findstr /i winload

Windows System Initialization



    Loading the Operating System Kernel

    Initializing the Kernel

    Starting Subsystems

    Starting Session 0   for security and high privilege processes such as services. NO user is loged into session 0. **** *Can be tricked into executing malicious commands via services

    Starting Session 1

In Windows, the kernel is named Ntoskrnl.exe and is a critical system file. It does the following tasks during the boot process:

    Loads the Windows Registry

    Loads device drivers

    Starts the system pagefile located at C:\pagefile.sys

    Loads hal.dll

        hal.dll provides abstraction between hardware interfaces and Ntoskrnl.exe

Once the kernel is done loading it spawns System which hosts threads that only run in kernel mode responsible things like drivers. System then spawns the session management processes smss.exe and csrss.exe

Q: What can I do if the Windows boot settings became corrupted?

A: Fix it with the bcdedit command
BCDEdit command help

Delete the Legacy Operating System ( /f = force)

bcdedit /delete {ntldr} /f
