Linux


for linux use PS -elf or ps -aux < --- preferred

Processes Listing
ps show processes
top command is used to show the Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system.
Use f to change parameters, space to add, then q to exit
ps aux – print in order executed
startup processes

ps -elf | head (do a full format listing of all running processes on the system in long format)
ps -elf --forest (Displays processes in an ASCII tree)
netstat -palonut (View network connections and their associated processes)
Process Ownership
grep UID /etc/login.defs (show range of User IDs for system and human users)
Signals
Terminate processes
Ignore
signalservicename&gt; status/start/stop/restart
Kill process
Stop processes
kill -l (list supported signals)
EX: kill -19 &lt;PID of Process&gt;
Check status/start/stop/restart a service on sysV
$ service &lt;servicename&gt; status/start/stop/restart
EX: $ service sshd status
List all unit files that systemd has listed as active
systemctl list-units
Jobs
jobs command will list all jobs and their status
fg (foreground) ctrl+z to stop the job
bg (background)
Cron Jobs
The cron daemon checks the directories /var/spool/cron, /etc/cron.d and the file /etc/crontab
***One of these is root protected so you have to use sudo to cat things inside of it***
have to know the user name who is running cron job
sudo cat var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
File Descriptors
$ sudo lsof (View File Descriptors using the LSOF command.)
sudo lsof | tail -30 (List all open files being used by every process)
sudo lsof -c sshd (List all open files for a specific process)
List all the proc directories.
ls -l /proc/
Grab the PID of a process.
ps -elf | grep sshd
List contents for that PID directory.
sudo ls -l /proc/14139
Orphan Processes
ps --forest -el
0 S root 22445 8834 0 80 0 - 4998 wait 21:00 pts/0 00:00:00 | | | \_ /bin/bash ./show-orphan.sh
0 S root 22446 22445 0 80 0 - 3644 hrtime 21:00 pts/0 00:00:00 | | | \_ sleep 5

0 S root 22440 1 0 80 0 - 3644 hrtime 21:00 pts/0 00:00:00 sleep 5 &lt;-- First Orphan
Zombie Processes
ps -elf |grep -v grep | grep sleep
0 Z root 24346 24345 0 80 0 - 0 - 21:26 pts/0 00:00:00 [sleep] &lt;defunct&gt; &lt;-- Zombie
0 Z root 24347 24345 0 80 0 - 0 - 21:26 pts/0 00:00:00 [sleep] &lt;defunct&gt; &lt;-- Zombie
What is the process ID (PID) of the SysV Init daemon?
ps -aux | grep init
How many child processes did SysV Init daemon spawn?
First find PID use:
sudo lsof -c init (if you know the process)
Then run:
ps --ppid 1 (shows all the child processes)
-------------------------or-------------------------
$ htop
Identify all of the arguments given to the ntpd daemon (service) using ps.
Format: List all options with parameters (include numbers).
$ ps -elf | grep ntpd
What is the parent process to Bombadil’s Bash process? (name of the binary, not the absolute path)
$ echo $PPID
--------or---------
$ htop

Identify the file mapped to the fourth file descriptor (handle) of the cron process.
HINT: There might be multiple cron processes, but only one with the answer. Flag format: /absolute/path
$ sudo lsof
--------or---------
$ sudo lsof -c cron
Look in the FD column for 3 because count starts at 0 making 3 equivalent to the fourth file descriptor.
cron 1338 root 3u REG 0,19 5 10555 /run/crond.pid
Identify the permissions that cron has on the file identified in Processes 5. HINT: Read the man page for
lsof to understand permissions.
sudo lsof -c cron (process)
take the path and do:
ls -l /run/crond.pid
Identify the names of the orphan processes on the SysV system.
NOTE: Remember, orphan processes spawn and die periodically. Try monitoring the processes list with
top or htop to find them. Flag format: in alphabetical order with all non-alphabetic characters removed:
Name,Name,Name,Name HINT: Only character names!
htop
hit f2, column, add ppid to it
aragorn,brucewayne,eowyn,tolkien

Locate zombie processes on the SysV system. Identify the zombie processes&#39; parent process.
NOTE: Remember, zombie processes only live until the parent process kills and removes them from the
system’s process table. Try monitoring the processes list with top or htop to find them.
Flag format: /absolute/path
/bin/funk

Locate the strange open port on the SysV system. Identify the command line executable and its
arguments. Flag format: /executable/path -arguments
Did the following command to find active listening ports: netstat -tuln or netstat -ano
To find the PID: sudo lsof -i:9999
After finding the PID, looked for the PID: ps -elf
Elf allows you to see the path and arguments.
Locate the strange open port on the SysV system. Identify how the process persists between reboots.
The flag is the absolute path for the file that contains the persistence mechanism, and the configuration
option. HINT: Persistence is defined here. Flag format: filepath,configuration_option
/etc/inittab (It starts with the kernel executing the first process on the machine, or the Initialization daemon. In
SysV machines it is the /etc/init program. Then, init reads /etc/inittab to start creating processes in groups called
Run Levels. The processes that each Run Level starts are defined in /etc/rc*.d)
cat /etc/inittab
configurtaion_ option 91:2345:respawn:/bin/netcat -lp 9999

Examine the process list to find the ssh process. Then, identify the symbolic link to the absolute path for
its executable in the /proc directory. The flag is the absolute path to the symbolic link, and the file it is
linked to. Flag format: /absolute/path,/absolute/path
ps aux | grep ssh or pgrep sshd
sudo ls -l /proc/1834 (process ID)
/proc/1876/exe,/usr/sbin/sshd
Identify the file that contains udp connection information. Identify the process using port 123.
For the flag, enter:
Process name
File descriptor number for the udp socket
Its permissions as shown in lsof
Flag format: name,#,permission
sudo lsof -i udp:123 or sudo lsof -i:123
ntpd 1469 ntp 19u IPv4 12428 0t0 UDP 10.17.0.7:ntp
Answer: ntpd,19,U

Locate the strange open port on the SysV system. Identify how the process persists between reboots.

The flag is the absolute path for the file that contains the persistence mechanism, and the configuration
option. HINT: Persistence is defined here. Flag format: filepath,configuration_option
netstat -tuln
ps -aux | grep 9999
Identify one of the human-readable file handles by the other program that creates a zombie process.
NOTE: Remember, zombie processes only live until the parent process kills them. Try monitoring the
processes list with top or htop to find them. The flag is the text from one of the files it reads.
$ htop
Saw the zombie process thenine
$ ps -aux

Strings /usr/local/bin/thenine (use strings because of how the output was)
Then you see strange paths //run//thering
Cat //run//thering
Then see another strange path //opt//mysoul
Cat //opt//mysoul

Scenario: Analysts have found a dump of commands on the Internet that refer to the Terra machine. The
command history for one of the users with an interactive login is being stolen via unknown means. The
network analysts can’t find any persistent connections, but notice a spike in traffic on logon and logoff.
